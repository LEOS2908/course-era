                    Segment tree is a data structure that answer query in the time compexity of log(n). 
                    There are many type of segment tree, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>rmq segment tree</li>
                            <li>lazy segment tree</li>
                            <li>merge sort tree</li>
                            <li>persistent segment tree</li>
                            <li>sum segment tree</li>
                            <li>segment tree beat</li>

                    Z-function
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Suppose we are given a string s of length n. 
                    The Z-function for this string is an array of length n where the i-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position i that coincide with the first characters of s.
                    In other words, z[i] is the length of the longest common prefix between s and the suffix of s starting at i.
                    There are many applications of Z-function, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>find all of the position that string s occur in string t</li>
                        <li>numbers of distinct substrings</li>
                        <li>string compression</li>
                    </ul>

                    Disjoint set union
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This data structure provides the following capabilities. 
                    We are given several elements, each of which is a separate set. 
                    A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets, and it will be able to tell in which set a specific element is. 
                    The classical version also introduces a third operation, it can create a set from a new element.
                    Thus the basic interface of this data structure consists of only three operations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>make_set(v) - creates a new set consisting of the new element v</li>
                        <li>union_sets(a, b) - merges the two specified sets 
                            (the set in which the element a is located, and the set in which the element b is located)</li>
                        <li>find_set(v) - returns the representative (also called leader) of the set that contains the element v. </li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
